# NixOS

I am preparing to move to [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). I may still include
notes here for archival purposes, commentary, tutorials, and guides, but
when that happens, the canonical source of truth will be the Nix code.

The structure of this book follows [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/)
(you can search for packages [here](https://search.nixos.org/packages)).

I still have some notes on [Arch Linux](./arch.md).
