# [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)

I used to use [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) and there really wasn't
anything wrong with it. The reason I switched was mainly philosophical, kitty
just did too much like the whole integrated tab / window splitting and so on.
Terminal emulators should be relatively simple and leave the complexity to
other programs (your window manager, tmux, etc.). Alacritty doesn't too much,
but has all the features I've come to expect from a terminal emulator. Also,
the vim mode is sometimes useful if you really don't want to use the mouse.

See [features.md](
https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/blob/master/docs/features.md)
for an overview of supported features.
