# fish

[Fish](http://fishshell.com/) is a non-POSIX compliant
shell that can do a lot of interesting things.

See my [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/~vazae) for inspiration.

Package manager is [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)
although it has its quirks (can only update all packages).

Theme is "Tomorrow", run `fish_config` to select it.
