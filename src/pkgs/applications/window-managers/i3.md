# i3

- use `xev` to get keysym names (i.e. `[` is bracketleft)

## cursor spins on empty background

- see [arch wiki -
  i3](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/I3#Mouse_cursor_remains_in_waiting_mode)
- see [i3wm user guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#exec)
- see [freedesktop.org - startup-notification-spec](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/startup-notification-spec/)
- run offending command in i3 config with `exec --no-startup-id`
- i3 has startup notifications, i.e. when an application
  finishes starting, it will signal to i3 that it's finished,
  i3 will change the cursor from waiting to normal.
- but if the application doesn't support startup notifications,
  it'll take 1 minute for the cursor to reset to normal

- [sddm](#sddm) executes `~/.xprofile` by default
  (check `/usr/share/sddm/scripts/Xsession`).
- nicer to have single script for all commands in
  `~/.xprofile` than preface every command with `exec` in i3
- (imagined) problem: likely caused by daemons in `~/.xprofile`
- seem to have no effect if not directly spawned
  by `exec` in i3 config (`~/.config/i3/config`)
