# sioyek

- [sioyek](https://sioyek.info/)
- relatively new viewer explicitly designed for
  scientific use (research papers, technical books)

```shell
paru -S sioyek
```

- pretty good, out-of-the-box integration with
  [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex)

```vim
let g:vimtex_view_method = 'sioyek'
```
