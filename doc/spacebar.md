# [Spacebar](https://github.com/somdoron/spacebar)

Spacebar is the bar that used to be part of yabai, but was removed.
The default spacebar status bar uses font icons, 
install the font by double clicking on final.ttf, 
which was constructed from [feather.ttf](https://github.com/AT-UI/feather-font) 
and [alt.ttf](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons/blob/master/Fonts/Feather.ttf). 
The first was missing the coffee icon, 
the second had weirdly glitched icons for some of them. 
Merged together via [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io/en-US).
